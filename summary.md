# Productionizing a Machine Learning Model with AWS Lambda

No matter how sophisticated we may make our models out to be, they are only

In this article, theÂ reader will take on the role of a tech lead developing a
model for a medical clinic that seeks a solution to automatically detect if a
patient has cancer. The reader will develop a Machine Learning model and then
enable it for online consumption using AWS Lambda.
