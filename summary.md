# Productionizing a Machine Learning Model with AWS Lambda
No matter how sophisticated we may make our models out to be, they are only
useful insofar as others can use them to make predictions.


In this article, theÂ reader will take on the role of a tech lead developing a
model for a medical clinic that seeks a solution to automatically detect if a
patient has cancer. The reader will develop a Machine Learning model and then
enable it for online consumption using AWS Lambda. The end solution is a model

Skills taught: training and validating an AI model; creating an AWS Lambda
function; enabling an HTTP endpoint; and optimizing the size of the deployment
package with AWS Lambda Layers.
