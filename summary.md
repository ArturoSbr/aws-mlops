# Productionizing a Machine Learning Model with AWS Lambda
Data Science lies at the intersection of statistical analysis and software
engineering. As a consequence, the key to becoming a world-class Data Scientist
is to acknowledge that no matter how sophisticated our AI models may be, they
are only valuable insofar as others can use them to make predictions. In
particular, learning how to leverage the cloud to build productive Machine
Learning solutions is an invaluable skill that all scientists can benefit from
learning.

In this article, theÂ reader will take on the role of an AI consultant developing
a model for a medical clinic that seeks a solution to automatically detect 
malignant tumors in their patients' scans. The reader will develop a Machine
Learning model and then enable it for online consumption using AWS Lambda. The
end solution will be a simple prediction service that the clinic can interact
with in order to predict if their patients' scans are indicative of a malignant
tumor.

Skills taught: training an AI model; creating an AWS Lambda function;
enabling an HTTP endpoint; and optimizing the size of the deployment package
with AWS Lambda Layers.
