# Productionizing a Machine Learning Model with AWS Lambda
Data Science lies at the intersection of statistical analysis and software
engineering. As a consequence, the key to becoming a world-class Data Scientist
is to acknowledge that no matter how sophisticated our AI models may be, they
are only valuable insofar as others can use them to make predictions. In
particular, being able to leverage the cloud to build productive Machine
Learning solutions is an invaluable skill that all scientists can benefit from
having.

In this article, theÂ reader will take on the role of an AI consultant developing
a model for a medical clinic that seeks to automatically detect malignant
tumors. The reader will develop a Machine Learning model and then enable it for
online consumption using AWS Lambda. The end product will be a simple online
prediction service that the clinic can use to detect malignant tumors in
patients' scans.

Skills taught: training an AI model; creating an AWS Lambda function;
enabling an HTTP endpoint; and optimizing the size of the deployment package
with AWS Lambda Layers.
