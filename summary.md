# Productionizing a Machine Learning Model with AWS Lambda
Data Science lies at the intersection of statistical analysis and software
engineering. The path to becoming a world-class Data Scientist starts with
acknowledging that no matter how sophisticated our AI models may be, they are
only valuable insofar as others can use them to make predictions. Once
acknowledged, we can differentiate ourselves by learning how to develop end-to-
end Machine Learning solutions that people all around the world can use to make
predictions.

In this article, theÂ reader will take on the role of an AI consultant developing
a model for a medical clinic that seeks a solution to automatically detect if a
patient has cancer. The reader will develop a Machine Learning model and then
enable it for online consumption using AWS Lambda. The end solution will be a
Machine Learning model that the clinic can interact with in order to predict if
their patients' scans are indicative of a malignant tumor.

Skills taught: training and validating an AI model; creating an AWS Lambda
function; enabling an HTTP endpoint; and optimizing the size of the deployment
package with AWS Lambda Layers.
